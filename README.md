  This is a Node.js command-line application that accepts user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. The user is able to choose parameters such as color and shape as well as provide the text for the logo (up to 3 characters). It provides a quick way to generate a simple logo for projects. 
  
  For future development, I would like to have more shape choices and customizable parameters such as font style and size.
